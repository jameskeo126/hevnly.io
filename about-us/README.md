## The Hevnly dev team ##
Here's a quick introduction to the people that make Hevnly tech happen...

### Hector (JavaScript) ###
Coder. Engineer. Perfectionist. Hector draws on over a decade of experience to bring Hevnly to life on screens both small and large. He has a never-ending enthusiasm for simplicity and elegance and is typically involved from concept development all the way through to deploy. He also uses his zen-like temperament to mentor our less-experienced developers.

### Mario (Node.js) ###
Mario codes server-side apps using node.js and hapijs. He writes automated tests using mocha-js to assure only rock-solid code. If there's a problem, he'll code a solution. Even in his free time Mario enjoys coding javascript ... (really, he absolutely loves it!)

### Chris (Devops) ###
A cross between Willy Fog and a Neural Networks nerd, Chris draws on his lengthy experience in tech to boldly go where no devops has gone before. His latest mission is to make Go and AWS reach Hevnly status. When not coding he likes to randomly ask everyone for peer reviews on current topics, such as his inability to win at FIFA as FC Barcelona. 

### Leandro (PHP) ###
Leandro is our go-to when it comes to PHP and anything to do with our Vagrant Machine. He's Hevnly's in-house back-end guy, seamlessly tackling the many tasks and problems which the dev team constantly throw his way. He's an endless source of knowledge when it comes to all things software, both front-end and back-end. It's all-good with Leandro, as long as you don't mention Argentinian football.

### Mat (UI/UX) ###
Mat bridges the gap between design and code. His passion is in UI/UX but he understands that good design can be easily lost in the coding process and works meticulously to unify the two. He is all about the "quantifiable self" and has all sorts of metrics on his life but don't worry, true to his role at Hevnly, he has plenty of right-brain attributes as well.
