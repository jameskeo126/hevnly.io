## The Hevnly dev team ##
Here are the people that make Hevnly tech happen.

### Hector (JavaScript) ###
Coder. Engineer. Perfectionist. Hector draws on over a decade of experience to bring Hevnly to life on screens small and large. Typically involved from concept development all the way through to deploy, mentoring less experienced developers. Has a seemingly never ending enthusiasm for simplicity and elegance.

### Mario (Node.js) ###
Mario codes server side apps using node.js and hapijs. He writes automated tests using mocha-js just to make sure he only delivers rock solid code. If there's a problem, then he'll code a solution. In his free time, Mario enjoys coding javascript, he loves it.

### Chris (Devops) ###
A cross between Willy Fog and a Neural Networks nerd, Chris draws on his long experience in tech to boldly go where no devops has gone before. His latest mission is to make Go and AWS reach Hevnly status. When not coding, he likes to randomly ask everyone for peer reviews on current topics, such as his inability to win at FIFA as FC Barcelona. 

### Leandro (PHP) ###
Leandro is the go-to guy when it comes to PHP and anything to do with our Vagrant Machine. He's hevnly's in-house backend guy, seamlessly juggling multiple tasks and problems which hevnly's dev team constantly throws at him. He's a great source of knowledge when it comes to all things software, both front-end and back-end.

It's all good with Leandro, as long as you don't mention Boca Juniors.

### Mat (UI/UX) ###
Mat closes the gap between design and code. His passion is in UI/UX however he understands that good design can be lost when converting this into code and so buffers the gap between them. He is all about the "quantifiable self" and has all sorts of metrics about his life.
