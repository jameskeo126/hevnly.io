# Tech stack #

What ever is best for the project. Monolithic systems are not Hevnly and neither is forcing people to use a language that does not suit the project. [@hevnlylabs](https://twitter.com/hevnlylabs) follows most of the tech that is currently used.

# Open-source #

Every project Hevnly considers ends up with the question "can we open source this?". It's not fair or right to build systems using open-source projects and not give what you can back to the community. Check out what has been done so far at [github](https://github.com/hevnly/).
